Datadriven customer segmentation with python:

This published repository is a generalized code of my masterthesis.

Aim of the thesis was to check how a model for customer segmentation model in python can look. More detailed, the value of a customer in the model is represented by the concept lfrmp which is commonly used in customer value analysis. To cluster the customers according to their lrfmp characteristics k-Means algorithm is applied.

To demonstrate the usability of the code a test dataset is uploaded.


The used version of python is 3.6.5.
